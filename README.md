# Datadome Interstitial API Python

## How It Works
    - Based off a post request in python, the user can choose to send a proxy (if not running localhost) and the URL for the cookie wanted. 
    - In return the scripts will send the user the response data including the useragent,proxy,url, and the cookie of the solve within 3-5 seconds.
## Why
    - I recently dropped a CloudFlare API, and wanted to replicate the idea for Datadome
    - Although reversal gens are extremely quicker, I wanted to have something for others to use for free :)


## Usage
    Run server.py to start the flask server
    Run the test script to recieve the token
    The server will also log the responses to a txt for both the server end and client side info
    THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR SITES THAT HAVE SLIDER ENABLED
